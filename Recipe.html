		<h2>Fried Rice</h2>
		
		<h3>list of Ingredients  (6-8 persons)</h3>
		<ul>
    		<li>4 cups of rice</li>
   		<li>5 cups of sliced Cabbage</li>
   		<li>2 cups of sliced Carrot</li>
   		<li>Green beans {2 cups}</li>
    		<li>Peas {half cup}(optional)</li>
    		<li>1 cup of sliced Green pepper</li>
    		<li>Liver {0.3kg}</li>
    		<li>Meat {2kg}(chicken, beef or goat meat)</li>
    		<li>Vegetable oil {150ml}</li>
    		<li>cup of sliced Onions</li>
    		<li>Curry powder (coloring spice) {2 Tablespoons}</li>
    		<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
		</section>
		</ul>
		

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Parboil the goat meat, chicken or any other you chose with all the necessary ingredient (teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions, teaspoon of thyme spice, teaspoon of curry, 2 cubes of maggi or knorr). Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and grill, deep fry or barbecue. Be sure to reserve the stock (meat water)</li>
		<li>Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray as you can find in the video below or the image above. This process is easy, I normally use just a knife and chopping board or a tray.</li>
		<li>Remove the white center seeds from the green pepper and also slice.</li>
		<li>Parboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about 80% done. (You will learn more about this from the video below). You have to observe the rice closely. it doesnt need to be too soft or too hard, just almost done. You can add water as you observe.
		<li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow to dry, then pour in about 150ml of groundnut or vegetable oil (some folks also prefer cooking margarine) If you want to use cooking margarine 150g would be enough.
		<li>Allow to heat then add the sliced onions stir for 1-2 minutes then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of this two can actually go first. Add the cabbage also.
		<li>Stir for 1-2 minutes then add the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish color of fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color.) meat stock (water from the meat), add ground pepper (optional), add a teaspoon of salt and the chopped liver, add 1-2 cubes of maggi or knorr then stir and taste, you may add more salt.	
		<li>You would have a yellowish mixture which would often taste overly spiced, don’t worry the rice would balance the taste. (If it doesn’t taste overly spiced it is advisable to add another cube of maggi and salt so it doesn’t become tasteless after you add the white rice {a trick}).
		<li>If you are satisfied with the taste then add the green pepper, stir, add the almost-done white rice, stir, cover your pot and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, you are done with fried rice.
